<h2 id="c1">Web Dev</h2>
<p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications, from designing the appearance to coding the functionality. 

It’s a mix of technical skills and creative problem-solving: you need to understand how to write functional code, how to build user-friendly layouts, debug issues, optimize performance, etc.Technology plays a massive role in our everyday lives,<br> from the easiest of applications to the most revolutionary inventions. A web developer has created every website or web page that we come across—but what is web development specifically, and what does a web developer do?

For a beginner, it can appear to be complicated, perplexing, and, to some extent, an inaccessible field. Therefore, to reveal some insight into this exciting industry, we’ve put together a fundamental introduction to web development and all it takes to turn into a full-fledged web developer. 

This article will cover website development basics in detail and outline all the necessary skills and tools you’ll need to break into this field. Before you  go for one of the  degrees for web developers  and jump into a Web Development career, go through the details to see if web development is for you, and then start learning the essential skills.</p>

<h2 id="c2">Oop</h2>
<p>OOPs stands for Object-oriented programming. OOPs in Java organizes a program around the various objects and well-defined interfaces. The OOPs Concepts in Java are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts aim <br>to implement real-world entities in programs.Object is a real world entities. which contains properties(state), behaviour and identities. Like example: pen, So here body, refill, colour is a properties(state) of pen, writing is a behaviour of pen and unique id is identities of pen. In programming language properties define as a data member, behaviour as a member function(method) and The identities of the object is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.Inheritance means when one entity inherit<br> all the properties and behaviours of a super entity that is knows as Inheritance.

In java When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object. In real life if you want to access existing properties and behaviours then inheritance came in picture.

For Example:- If you use 2G or 3G sim network of Airtel or Vodafone in your 2G or 3G support phone. Also that sim use in your 4G support phone. That means you access(inherit) the behaviours of 2G and 3G sim in your 4G supported phone.

Then you can say in technical world, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.</p>

<h2 id="c3">Networks</h2>
<p>Computer networking refers to connected computing devices (such as laptops, desktops, servers, smartphones, and tablets) and an ever-expanding array of IoT devices (such as cameras, door locks, doorbells, refrigerators, audio/visual systems, <br>thermostats, and various sensors) that communicate with one another.Computer networking forms the backbone of digital communication, allowing devices to exchange data across various distances and configurations. It involves both physical components, such as routers, switches, cables, and wireless access points, and logical elements like IP addressing, routing protocols, and network topologies. Networks can range from small, localized systems like LANs to large-scale infrastructures like WANs and the internet, each designed to meet specific performance and scalabi<br>lity needs.

The operation of a network depends on defined protocols that govern how data is formatted, transmitted, routed, and received. Understanding these basics is necessary for working with or troubleshooting modern network environments, whether in homes, enterprises, or data centers. Many tech jobs require some knowledge of computer networking basics. This blog outlines the foundational concepts, key types of networks, and basic protocols that structure modern communication systems.</p>
